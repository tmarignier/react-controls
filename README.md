## Testing
Included is a test framework for all of your React testing needs.  We are using Jest to run the test suite and generate snapshots, plus Enzyme for component introspection.

Tests should be collocated within the component they represent. Test files should be named `index.test.tsx` and mocks must be named `myMock.mock.ts`.

## Deployment

## Scripts
- `npm run setup:yarn`
  - Install the package dependencies via yarn
- `npm install`
  - Install dependencies (the ol' fashioned way)
- `npm run test`
  - Run the test suite
- `npm run test:watch`
  - Run the test suite in watch mode
- `npm run test:update`
  - Update the failing snapshot tests
